HTTP quick reminders

## HTTP Methods
- GET: safe and idempotent (in theory); should not modify server state.
- POST: not necessarily idempotent; used for creating resources or non-idempotent operations.
- PUT: idempotent; used for creating or replacing a resource at a specific URI.
- PATCH: partial update; not necessarily idempotent.
- DELETE: idempotent; removes a resource.

## Common status codes
- 200 OK: request succeeded
- 201 Created: resource created successfully
- 204 No Content: success but no content to return
- 400 Bad Request: client input error (malformed request)
- 401 Unauthorized: missing or invalid authentication credentials
- 403 Forbidden: authenticated but not authorized for this action
- 404 Not Found: resource does not exist
- 409 Conflict: resource conflict (e.g., duplicate creation)
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: valid syntax but semantic errors
- 429 Too Many Requests: rate limited
- 500 Internal Server Error: server-side error
- 502 Bad Gateway: upstream server error
- 503 Service Unavailable: service temporarily unavailable

## Headers
- Content-Type: MIME type of the body (e.g., application/json, text/plain)
- Authorization: credentials (Bearer token, Basic auth, etc.)
- Accept: what response format client accepts
- User-Agent: client identifier
- X-Request-ID: request tracing/correlation ID
- Cache-Control: caching directives (no-cache, max-age, etc.)

## Best practices
- Timeouts matter when calling external APIs; always set a request timeout.
- Use idempotency keys for POST requests that should be safe to retry.
- Return appropriate status codes; don't use 200 for errors.
- Include error details in response body (not just status code).
- Use proper HTTP methods; don't use GET for state-changing operations.
- Version your API (URL path or header).
- Support pagination for list endpoints.
- Use HTTPS in production; never send credentials over HTTP.

## REST conventions
- Use nouns for resources, not verbs: `/users` not `/getUsers`.
- Use plural nouns: `/users/123` not `/user/123`.
- Use HTTP methods to indicate actions: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (replace), PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
- Return proper status codes and consistent error format.
- Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination: `/users?page=1&limit=10`.
